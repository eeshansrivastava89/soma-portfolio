# The Build Log: Vision & Strategy

> **One-Liner:** Learning AI-native product development in public — and documenting everything.

---

## 1. What This Is

I'm a senior data scientist pushing into unfamiliar territory: building full-stack products using AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Copilot), then doing data science on what I build.

This is my learning lab. Everything is public:
- The code
- The decisions (and mistakes)
- The blog posts about what I learned
- The data generated by real users

**The Build Log** is where I document this journey.

**Build With Me** is the optional path for anyone who wants to contribute.

---

## 2. Why I'm Doing This

Data science is changing. The old model — clean CSVs, Jupyter notebooks, sklearn — isn't enough anymore.

The new model:
- Build products that generate data
- Use AI tools to move faster
- Ship to production, get real users
- Analyze real behavior, not sample datasets

I want to be ready for this future. The best way to learn is to do it in public and write about it.

## 3. The Build Loop

```
BUILD ──► SHIP ──► GROW ──► ANALYZE ──► SHARE ──► REPEAT
```

**Build** — Use AI tools to ship something functional  
**Ship** — Deploy to production (Fly.io, Vercel, wherever)  
**Grow** — Get real users generating real data  
**Analyze** — Do actual data science on real behavior  
**Share** — Write about what I learned (blog, Substack)

Each loop produces: a working product, a dataset, a blog post.

## 4. Current Project

### A/B Testing Simulator ✅ Live

**What:** Memory game that generates behavioral data for A/B testing.

**Stack:** Astro, PostHog, Supabase, Plotly.js

**URL:** [eeshans.com/ab-simulator](https://eeshans.com/ab-simulator)

**What I Learned:**
- PostHog instrumentation from scratch
- Real-time dashboards with PostgREST
- How AI tools accelerated the build (and where they failed)

---

## 5. Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```
soma-portfolio/
├── packages/
│   ├── ab-simulator/      → eeshans.com/ab-simulator/
│   ├── build-with-me/     → eeshans.com/build-log/ (rename pending)
│   └── shared/            → Common layouts, utils, styles
├── src/                   → Main portfolio site (eeshans.com/)
└── scripts/
    └── fetch-data.mjs     → Pulls GitHub issues for build-with-me
```

### URL Structure (Current → Target)

| Package | Current URL | Target URL |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Root portfolio | `/` | `/` (no change) |
| A/B Simulator | `/ab-simulator/` | `/ab-simulator/` (no change) |
| Build With Me | `/build-with-me/` | `/build-log/` (rename) |

### Rename Tasks

To rename `/build-with-me/` → `/build-log/`:
1. `packages/build-with-me/astro.config.mjs` — change `base: '/build-log'`
2. `packages/build-with-me/astro.config.mjs` — change `outDir: '../../dist/build-log'`
3. `Dockerfile` nginx config — update location block
4. Root `package.json` — update script names (optional)
5. Package folder name — consider renaming `packages/build-with-me/` → `packages/build-log/`

---

## 6. The `/build-log/` Page

Single page serves both purposes:

### Page Structure

1. **Hero** — "The Build Log" framing (your journey, AI-native building)
2. **Current Projects** — What's live, what's in progress, key stats
3. **Latest Learnings** — Links to blog posts / key insights
4. **Want to Contribute?** — GitHub issues table (clearly optional)
5. **Contributors** — Credit for anyone who's shipped

### The 80/20 Balance

| Section | Focus | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Hero + Projects + Learnings | 80% | Your work, your journey |
| Contribute + Contributors | 20% | Optional collaboration |

Visitors see your work first. Contribution is an invitation, not the main event.

### Existing Components (in `packages/build-with-me/src/components/`)

| Component | Purpose | Keep/Modify |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `TasksView.tsx` | Orchestrator for search + filters + table | Keep |
| `TasksTable.tsx` | GitHub issues DataTable | Keep |
| `ContributorCards.tsx` | Contributor display | Keep |
| `SearchBar.tsx` | Fuzzy search | Keep |
| `FilterPanel.tsx` | Multi-select filters | Keep |
| `StartHereGuide.tsx` | Onboarding accordion | Keep |
| `VideoModal.tsx` | Video player overlay | Keep |
| `ActivityFeed.tsx` | Recent activity | Keep |
| `DataFreshness.tsx` | Sync indicator | Remove (not needed) |

## 7. Content Strategy

**Blog posts to write:**
- "How I Built an A/B Simulator with Claude and Cursor"
- "PostHog from Zero: Instrumenting a Real Product"
- "What 1000 Puzzle Games Taught Me About User Behavior"

**Format:** Technical but accessible. Show the code. Show the data. Show the mistakes.

**Distribution:** Blog → LinkedIn → Substack

---

## 8. Contributor Details

For those who want to go deeper:

**Watch:** Everything is public. Read the code, follow along.

**Contribute:** Browse open GitHub issues. Labeled by type and difficulty.

**Get Credit:** Merged PRs = listed contributor. Use it in your portfolio.

**No Pressure:** No deadlines. No cohorts. Async by default.

## 9. Roadmap

### Now
- [x] A/B Simulator live
- [x] Build With Me page built (at `/build-with-me/`)
- [ ] Rename route `/build-with-me/` → `/build-log/`
- [ ] Revise page with Build Log framing (80/20 structure)
- [ ] First "How I Built This" blog post

### Next
- [ ] Regular build log posts (1-2/month)
- [ ] Second project started
- [ ] First external contributor (when it happens)

### Later
- [ ] 5+ contributors
- [ ] Video content (short demos)
- [ ] Substack with consistent readership

## 10. Working Principles

1. **Solo-first** — Everything works without contributors
2. **AI-native** — Use the tools, document what works
3. **Real products** — Not toys, things people use
4. **Real data** — Generate it, don't download it
5. **Ship small** — Brutalize scope, iterate fast
6. **Write about it** — The blog is the product

**Status:** Personal educational project. Non-commercial.

**Rules:** Zero revenue. No employees. No employer IP. Personal time only.
